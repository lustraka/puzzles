# Puzzling in Programming?
Working on puzzles may seem like a waste of your available programming time. After all, it seems like you’re not really producing anything useful and you’re not advancing your current projects forward.

However, there are several advantages to taking some time off to practice with programming puzzles:

- Programming puzzles are usually better specified and more contained than your regular job tasks. They offer you the chance to **practice logical thinking** on problems that are less complex than the ones you typically need to handle in your day job.
- You can often challenge yourself with several similar puzzles. This allows you to **build procedural memory**, much like muscle memory, and get experience with structuring certain kinds of code.
- Puzzles are often designed with an eye towards a solution. They allow you to **learn about and apply algorithms** that are tried and tested and are an important part of any programmer’s toolbox.
- For some puzzle solutions, even the greatest supercomputers can be too slow if the algorithm is inefficient. You can **analyze the performance** of your solution and get experience to help you understand when a straightforward method is fast enough and when a more optimized procedure is necessary.
- Most programming languages are well-suited for solving programming puzzles. This gives you a great opportunity to **compare different programming languages** for different tasks. Puzzles are also a great way for getting to know a new programming language or trying out some of the newest features of your favorite language.

On top of all of this, challenging yourself with a programming puzzle is often pretty fun! When you add it all up, setting aside some time for puzzles can be very rewarding.

- Prompt engineering
  - **Specificity**: Be clear and specific with your instructions. Use questions, longer, more detailed prompts, delimiters to separate conceptual sections, etc.
  - **Context**. Give ample context on what you're trying to achive and how. Define roles. Add examples of an expected output (few-shot prompting).
  - **Reasoning**. Instruct the model to build complex answers incrementally instead for immediate answers. Spell out the necessary steps. Ask the model to tackle the challenge [step by step](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/zero_shot_cot) (link to Learn Prompting).
- Debug your code with ChatGPT’s help
- Pair program with ChatGPT and write better code
  - How can I improve variable naming in this code example?
  - Could you also improve the messages a user will read when interacting with this program?
  - Can you refactor the code into a function?
  - Please refactor the code so that 1 and 100 are default arguments. Also use an f-string to fix the input text message accordingly.
  - How can I save the randomly generated number?
  - Could you also add type hinting and a docstring to the function?
- Prompt ChatGPT for alternative implementations
  - What are alternative implementations of this problem?
- Get answers to your programming questions
  - What’s the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
  - What’s the difference between mutable vs immutable types
  - Can you show me a real-world example of both a tuple and a list?
  - What are good use cases for a tuple?
  - Please provide **some links** that explain the topic.
  - Please show me the link to the Python documentation that explains __init__.py.

> ChatGPT doesn’t perform a classic search, but instead generates text based on probabilistic proximity. Because of that, it may be able to tackle some information retrieval situations like the one shown above better than a search algorithm.

> The LLM behind ChatGPT has been trained on a large corpus of data, and it’s quite good at answering general programming questions. To double-check the answers that you get, you can ask it to provide you with links to sources, which will allow you to make sure that the model didn’t hallucinate.

- Next steps:
  - Prompt ChatGPT for **project ideas** and **implementation tips** — for example, which libraries to use for a project.
  - **Build** one of the suggested projects **by pair programming** with ChatGPT — and make sure that the project works!
  - **Refactor** one of your existing projects to **improve code quality**.
  - Let ChatGPT **write tests** for your project code.
  - **Generate documentation** for a project using ChatGPT.
