# Puzzling in Programming?
Working on puzzles may seem like a waste of your available programming time. After all, it seems like you’re not really producing anything useful and you’re not advancing your current projects forward.

However, there are several advantages to taking some time off to practice with programming puzzles:

- Programming puzzles are usually better specified and more contained than your regular job tasks. They offer you the chance to **practice logical thinking** on problems that are less complex than the ones you typically need to handle in your day job.
- You can often challenge yourself with several similar puzzles. This allows you to **build procedural memory**, much like muscle memory, and get experience with structuring certain kinds of code.
- Puzzles are often designed with an eye towards a solution. They allow you to **learn about and apply algorithms** that are tried and tested and are an important part of any programmer’s toolbox.
- For some puzzle solutions, even the greatest supercomputers can be too slow if the algorithm is inefficient. You can **analyze the performance** of your solution and get experience to help you understand when a straightforward method is fast enough and when a more optimized procedure is necessary.
- Most programming languages are well-suited for solving programming puzzles. This gives you a great opportunity to **compare different programming languages** for different tasks. Puzzles are also a great way for getting to know a new programming language or trying out some of the newest features of your favorite language.

On top of all of this, challenging yourself with a programming puzzle is often pretty fun! When you add it all up, setting aside some time for puzzles can be very rewarding.
